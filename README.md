## Project Summary

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of an insurance fraud detection use case.  
The project leverages historical insurance claim data to identify potentially fraudulent claims and enable early, risk-based decision-making in the claim approval process.

## Problem Statement

Insurance companies process a large volume of claims, a portion of which are fraudulent and lead to significant financial losses.  
Existing fraud detection approaches are largely manual and often identify fraud only after claim payouts have been made.  
There is a need for a data-driven solution to detect fraudulent claims early in the claims lifecycle.

## Business Objective

- Classify insurance claims as **fraudulent** or **legitimate** using historical claim data  
- Reduce financial losses caused by fraudulent payouts  
- Improve operational efficiency by prioritising high-risk claims for investigation
