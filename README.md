Fraudulent Claim Detection
Author: Anshaj Singh
Project Summary
This repository contains the implementation and analysis for an insurance fraud detection use case. The project uses historical insurance claim data to identify potentially fraudulent claims and support early risk-based decision-making in the claim approval process.
Problem Statement
Insurance companies process a large number of claims, a portion of which are fraudulent and result in significant financial losses. Existing fraud detection processes are largely manual and often identify fraud after payouts have already been made. There is a need for a data-driven approach to detect fraudulent claims early.
Business Objective
Classify insurance claims as fraudulent or legitimate using historical data
Reduce financial losses caused by fraudulent payouts
Improve efficiency of claim investigation by prioritising high-risk claims
